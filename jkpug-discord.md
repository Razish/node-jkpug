## FAQ
**1. How do I make it join my server?**
Log into [discordapp.com](www.discordapp.com) and visit `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=BotID&scope=bot&permissions=67243008`
Replace `BotID` with the value from the bot's page [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/) (You will also find your secret here, for `config.json`)

More information on the permissions value [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions)
